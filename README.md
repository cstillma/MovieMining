## Description ##
The goal of this data mining project is to discover trends in film runtime such that the findings can be applied in the film industry to produce more successful movies. Our dataset, which can be found below, contains information on over 950,000 films. We will be mining this information to look at the runtime feature's impact on other features and vice versa. Among our goals in determining what relationships exist here are to identify the ideal film length associated with high ratings. 

## Summary of Findings ##
### Questions Sought ##
- Is it possible to predict the runtime of a film based on its genre?
- Is it possible to predict the runtime of a film based on its country of origin?
- Is it possible to predict the runtime of a film based on its date of release?
- Can an ideal film length (may be a range) be identified which corresponds to high ratings from viewers?
